\#\# ðŸŒ† WHY LOCAL NEWS MATTERS

\#\#\# The Information Crisis

Communities across America face a local news crisis:  
\- \*\*2,900+ local newspapers\*\* have closed since 2005  
\- \*\*More than 200 million Americans\*\* live in "news deserts" or areas with limited local news access  
\- \*\*Civic participation declines\*\* when communities lack local journalism  
\- \*\*Misinformation fills the void\*\* left by trusted local sources

\#\#\# What Local News Provides

\*\*Democratic Infrastructure:\*\*  
\- Government accountability  
\- Civic information (elections, public meetings, policy)  
\- Community connection and shared identity  
\- Early warning systems for local challenges

\*\*Community Cohesion:\*\*  
\- Stories that reflect diverse residents  
\- Coverage of local culture, events, celebrations  
\- Platform for community voices and concerns  
\- Bridge between different demographic groups

\*\*Economic Function:\*\*  
\- Local business promotion and support  
\- Job listings and economic opportunity information  
\- Consumer protection and local commerce news

\#\# âš–ï¸ TRADITIONAL MEDIA BUYING VS. PRESS FORWARD

\#\#\# Traditional Approach

\*\*Principles:\*\*  
\- Maximize efficiency (lowest CPM)  
\- Optimize reach per dollar  
\- Minimize "wasted" impressions  
\- Consolidate to largest outlets  
\- Cut "redundant" coverage

\*\*Metrics:\*\*  
\- Cost per thousand (CPM)  
\- Total reach  
\- Cost per acquisition  
\- Return on ad spend (ROAS)

\*\*Outcomes:\*\*  
\- Money flows to largest outlets  
\- Small/hyperlocal outlets excluded  
\- "Inefficient" but valuable outlets lose funding  
\- News deserts expand

\#\#\# Press Forward Approach

\*\*Principles:\*\*  
\- Support ecosystem health  
\- Equitable outlet participation  
\- Value hyperlocal coverage  
\- Sustain diverse information sources  
\- Build democratic infrastructure

\*\*Metrics:\*\*  
\- Geographic coverage breadth  
\- Demographic diversity reached  
\- Number of outlets supported  
\- Community information ecosystem strength  
\- Long-term sustainability

\*\*Outcomes:\*\*  
\- Resources distributed across ecosystem  
\- Small outlets remain viable  
\- Communities retain local coverage  
\- Information diversity preserved  
\- Democratic infrastructure strengthened

\#\# ðŸ“Š WHY EVERY OUTLET MATTERS

\#\#\# Example 1: The "Small" Outlet \- AirGo Radio

\*\*The Numbers:\*\*  
\- \*\*2,075 weekly listeners\*\*  
\- One of the smallest outlets in Chicago Hub  
\- Could be easily excluded in efficiency-driven approach

\*\*The Reality:\*\*  
\- Serves Spanish-speaking immigrant communities on Chicago's Southwest Side  
\- Provides critical civic information in language communities trust  
\- Covers local government and issues ignored by larger outlets  
\- One of the few radio sources for specific neighborhoods

\*\*Press Forward Perspective:\*\*  
\- These 2,075 people deserve quality local information  
\- No other outlet effectively serves this specific audience  
\- Outlet sustainability ensures long-term community coverage  
\- Small audience â‰  small importance

\#\#\# Example 2: The "Redundant" Coverage \- Evanston

\*\*The Situation:\*\*  
\- \*\*Two outlets\*\* cover Evanston (population \~75,000):  
  \- Evanston Now (digital news)  
  \- Evanston Roundtable (print weekly)  
\- Traditional media buying would pick one, exclude the other

\*\*Why Both Matter:\*\*  
\- \*\*Different audiences:\*\* Digital vs. print readers (demographic differences)  
\- \*\*Different coverage:\*\* Breaking news vs. in-depth local reporting  
\- \*\*Competition drives quality:\*\* Each outlet pushes the other  
\- \*\*Resilience:\*\* If one fails, community isn't left in news desert  
\- \*\*Diversity:\*\* Different editorial perspectives and story choices

\*\*Press Forward Perspective:\*\*  
\- A 75,000-person city deserves multiple news sources  
\- Media competition is healthy for democracy  
\- One outlet â‰  sufficient coverage for entire community  
\- Redundancy in news infrastructure is a feature, not a bug

\#\#\# Example 3: The Comprehensive Package

\*\*Traditional Approach:\*\*  
\- Pick 8-12 largest outlets  
\- Focus on lowest CPM  
\- Exclude outlets serving "niche" communities  
\- Total cost: $50,000

\*\*Press Forward Approach:\*\*  
\- Include all outlets with Hub inventory  
\- Mix of large and hyperlocal  
\- Comprehensive geographic and demographic coverage  
\- Total cost varies based on inventory selection

\*\*The Trade-Off:\*\*  
\- Higher absolute cost  
\- Lower mathematical "efficiency"  
\- BUT: Reaches every community  
\- AND: Sustains entire ecosystem  
\- RESULT: Stronger democratic infrastructure

\#\# ðŸ› ï¸ PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS

\#\#\# For Package Building

\*\*When User Requests "All-Inclusive" or "Comprehensive":\*\*  
1\. \*\*Start with ALL outlets\*\* with Hub inventory in the system  
2\. \*\*Do not exclude\*\* outlets based on:  
   \- Small audience size  
   \- Geographic "redundancy"  
   \- Higher CPM  
   \- "Niche" demographic focus  
3\. \*\*Present accurate total cost\*\*  
4\. \*\*If cost exceeds budget:\*\*  
   \- Flag the constraint  
   \- Offer adjustment options (reduce frequency, shorter duration, shift inventory mix)  
   \- Let user decide which outlets to adjust or remove  
5\. \*\*Never make optimization decisions\*\* that exclude outlets without user direction

\#\#\# For Cost Analysis

\*\*Present Multiple Perspectives:\*\*  
\- Total cost  
\- Cost per outlet  
\- Geographic coverage achieved  
\- Demographic communities reached  
\- Number of outlets supported  
\- Estimated aggregate reach

\*\*Context Matters:\*\*  
\- Higher total cost may be justified by ecosystem support  
\- "Inefficient" by traditional metrics may be essential by Press Forward standards  
\- Support for small outlets has long-term democratic value

\#\#\# For Client Communication

\*\*Explain the Approach:\*\*  
\- Chicago Hub operates on Press Forward principles  
\- Goal is ecosystem sustainability, not just efficiency  
\- Every outlet serves a purpose in information infrastructure  
\- Comprehensive coverage has intrinsic value beyond reach metrics

\*\*Set Expectations:\*\*  
\- All-inclusive packages cost more than optimized packages  
\- Trade-off is comprehensive coverage vs. efficiency  
\- Investment supports long-term local journalism sustainability  
\- Decision reflects values about democratic infrastructure

\#\# â“ COMMON QUESTIONS

\#\#\# "Why include such a small outlet like AirGo Radio?"

Because the 2,075 people who rely on it for local news in Spanish deserve quality journalism. No other outlet effectively serves this audience. Excluding them contributes to news deserts for immigrant communities.

\#\#\# "Why not pick just the most efficient outlets?"

Because democracy requires diverse information sources. Efficiency optimization led to the current local news crisis. Press Forward takes a different approach: ecosystem health over individual transaction efficiency.

\#\#\# "Isn't redundant coverage wasteful?"

No. Multiple outlets covering the same geography creates:  
\- Competitive pressure for quality  
\- Different perspectives and story choices  
\- Resilience if one outlet fails  
\- Service to different demographic groups in same area

One news outlet for an entire community is insufficient for healthy democracy.

\#\#\# "How do we justify higher costs to clients?"

Frame it as infrastructure investment:  
\- Sustains long-term news availability  
\- Ensures comprehensive community coverage  
\- Builds relationships across diverse outlets  
\- Supports democratic information ecosystem  
\- Creates future advertising opportunities as outlets remain viable

\#\#\# "What if all-inclusive exceeds budget?"

1\. Present the full package with accurate costs  
2\. Flag that it exceeds budget  
3\. Offer adjustment approaches (frequency, duration, inventory mix)  
4\. Let client choose trade-offs  
5\. Never exclude outlets preemptively to fit budget

\---

\#\# ðŸŽ¯ THE BOTTOM LINE

\*\*Chicago Hub exists to support the entire local news ecosystem, not just the most efficient advertising buys.\*\*

When someone requests an "all-inclusive" or "comprehensive" Chicago Hub campaign:  
\- They're buying into the Press Forward mission  
\- They want to support the ecosystem  
\- They understand the trade-offs  
\- They expect all outlets to be included

\*\*Your role:\*\* Present accurate costs and complete coverage. Flag constraints. Offer options. Let them decide.

\*\*Not your role:\*\* Make efficiency-based exclusions. Apply traditional optimization. Decide which outlets "matter."
