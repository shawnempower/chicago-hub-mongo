\# PACKAGE BUILDING GUIDE

\#\# PURPOSE  
Step-by-step instructions for building media packages using Claude in the Chicago Hub Inventory Project.

\---

\#\# BEFORE YOU START

\#\#\# What You Need to Know  
1\. \*\*Available inventory:\*\* Multiple pricing options across participating outlets and 8 channels  
2\. \*\*Pricing is Hub-discounted:\*\* All prices shown are special Chicago Hub rates  
3\. \*\*Frequency tiers:\*\* Many items offer 1x, 6x, 12x tiers (volume discounts)  
4\. \*\*Monthly basis:\*\* Most pricing is monthly; we calculate multi-month by multiplying

\#\# THREE PACKAGE BUILDING APPROACHES

\#\#\# Approach 1: BUDGET-FIRST  
\*Start with spending target, explore what you can buy\*

\#\#\# Approach 2: SPECIFICATION-FIRST  
\*Start with outlet/channel requirements, calculate cost\*

\#\#\# Approach 3: ALL-INCLUSIVE  
\*Start with full ecosystem (29 outlets), adjust as needed\*

\---

\#\# APPROACH 1: BUDGET-FIRST PACKAGE BUILDING

\#\#\# When to Use  
\- Client has defined budget  
\- Want to maximize reach within spending limit  
\- Need to present multiple package options at different price points

\#\#\# Step-by-Step Workflow

\*\*Step 1: State Your Budget\*\*  
\`\`\`  
"I have $50,000/month budget for advertising"  
\`\`\`

\*\*Step 2: Define Any Requirements\*\*  
Optional filters to narrow options:  
\- Geographic focus: "South Side outlets only"  
\- Channel preference: "Newsletter and Website only"  
\- Outlet requirements: "Must include Chicago Sun-Times"  
\- Frequency: "12x tier preferred"

Example:  
\`\`\`  
"I have $50,000/month budget. Focus on South Side outlets, all channels, prefer 12x tier."  
\`\`\`

\*\*Step 3: Claude Explores Inventory\*\*  
Claude will:  
\- Filter to outlets matching criteria  
\- Identify available inventory  
\- Build package options at different price points near your budget  
\- Show what each option includes

Example response:  
\`\`\`  
OPTION A: $47,500/month  
\- 8 South Side outlets  
\- 45 ad units across all channels  
\- 12x tier where available  
\- Outlets: South Side Weekly, Hyde Park Herald, Chicago Defender, ...

OPTION B: $52,000/month    
\- Same 8 outlets  
\- Adds premium placements  
\- All 12x tier  
\- 53 ad units total  
\`\`\`

\*\*Step 4: Review and Refine\*\*  
\- Too expensive? "Remove Events channel" or "Switch to 6x tier"  
\- Under budget? "Add more outlets" or "Include premium placements"  
\- Just right? "This works \- proceed to insertion order"

\*\*Step 5: Calculate Campaign Duration\*\*  
State your campaign length:  
\`\`\`  
"Calculate for 6-month campaign"  
\`\`\`

Claude multiplies: $50,000/month Ã— 6 months \= $300,000 total

\*\*Step 6: Generate Documentation\*\*  
Request outputs:  
\`\`\`  
"Generate:  
1\. Package summary with cost breakdown  
2\. Master insertion order  
3\. Individual outlet orders"  
\`\`\`

\---

\#\# APPROACH 2: SPECIFICATION-FIRST PACKAGE BUILDING

\#\#\# When to Use  
\- You know which outlets you want  
\- Specific channel requirements  
\- Geographic or community targeting  
\- Following strategic media plan

\#\#\# Step-by-Step Workflow

\*\*Step 1: Define Your Specifications\*\*

\*\*By Outlets:\*\*  
\`\`\`  
"Show me all inventory for: Chicago Sun-Times, WBEZ, Block Club Chicago, South Side Weekly"  
\`\`\`

\*\*By Channels:\*\*  
\`\`\`  
"Build package with Newsletter and Website inventory across all outlets"  
\`\`\`

\*\*By Geography:\*\*  
\`\`\`  
"All North Side outlets, all channels"  
\`\`\`

\*\*By Combination:\*\*  
\`\`\`  
"Print and Radio in: Chicago Sun-Times, Chicago Defender, WVON, WRLL"  
\`\`\`

\*\*Step 2: Claude Shows Available Inventory\*\*  
You'll see:  
\- All matching ad units  
\- Prices at different frequency tiers  
\- Audience metrics for each  
\- Total count of options

\*\*Step 3: Make Selections\*\*  
Refine what you want:  
\- "Include all Newsletter at 12x tier"  
\- "Add Print but use 6x tier"  
\- "Remove Website from Chicago Sun-Times"  
\- "Keep Radio at 1x tier"

\*\*Step 4: Calculate Costs\*\*  
Claude totals up your selections:  
\- Cost by outlet  
\- Cost by channel  
\- Cost by frequency tier  
\- Total monthly cost

\*\*Step 5: Apply Duration\*\*  
\`\`\`  
"This package for 3 months"  
\`\`\`  
Monthly cost Ã— 3 \= campaign total

\*\*Step 6: Generate Orders\*\*  
Request insertion order documentation.

\#\# APPROACH 3: ALL-INCLUSIVE PACKAGE BUILDING

\#\#\# When to Use  
\- Supporting full Press Forward ecosystem  
\- Client wants maximum reach  
\- Comprehensive community coverage  
\- Multi-faceted campaign

\#\#\# Step-by-Step Workflow

\*\*Step 1: Request All-Inclusive Package\*\*  
\`\`\`  
"Show me cost for all outlets with Hub inventory, all channels, 12x tier"  
\`\`\`

\*\*Step 2: System Calculates Full Package\*\*  
Response includes:  
\- All participating outlets with hub inventory  
\- All 8 channels  
\- All pricing options (at 12x tier where available)  
\- Total monthly cost  
\- Total outlets/items breakdown

Example (illustrative, actual numbers vary):  
\`\`\`  
ALL-INCLUSIVE PACKAGE (All Participating Outlets, 8 Channels)  
Total Monthly Cost: Varies based on selections  
\- Print: Multiple outlets with various options  
\- Website: Multiple outlets with digital inventory  
\- Newsletter: Multiple outlets with email inventory  
\- Radio: Multiple stations with spot inventory  
\- Podcast: Multiple shows with sponsorship options  
\- Social Media: Various platforms available  
\- Events: Multiple event sponsorship opportunities  
\- Streaming Video: Video advertising options  
\`\`\`

\*\*Step 3: Assess Against Budget\*\*  
\- Within budget? Proceed to orders.  
\- Over budget? Move to Step 4\.

\*\*Step 4: Adjust If Needed\*\*  
Options for reducing cost:  
\- \*\*Remove channels:\*\* "Remove Events and Streaming Video"  
\- \*\*Change tiers:\*\* "Switch all to 6x tier instead of 12x"  
\- \*\*Remove specific outlets:\*\* "Exclude outlets under 5,000 audience"  
\- \*\*Channel priority:\*\* "Keep Print and Newsletter only"

Example:  
\`\`\`  
"Remove Events, Streaming Video, and Social Media channels. Recalculate."

NEW TOTAL: Varies by selection  
\- Print, Website, Newsletter, Radio, Podcast only  
\- Still covers all participating outlets  
\- Multiple ad units across channels  
\`\`\`

\*\*Step 5: Apply Campaign Duration\*\*  
\`\`\`  
"Calculate for 6-month campaign"  
\`\`\`  
$108,000 Ã— 6 \= $648,000 total investment

\*\*Step 6: Generate Comprehensive Orders\*\*  
All-inclusive packages benefit from:  
\- Master insertion order showing full ecosystem buy  
\- Individual orders for each outlet  
\- Package summary highlighting comprehensive reach

\#\# PACKAGE REFINEMENT TECHNIQUES

\#\#\# Adding Inventory  
\`\`\`  
"Add Chicago Reader's Newsletter inventory"  
"Include all Events sponsorships"  
"Add WBEZ's podcast placements"  
\`\`\`

\#\#\# Removing Inventory  
\`\`\`  
"Remove all Social Media"  
"Exclude outlets with less than 10,000 audience"  
"Drop the Events channel"  
\`\`\`

\#\#\# Changing Frequency Tiers  
\`\`\`  
"Switch all Print to 6x tier"  
"Change Newsletter to 12x tier"  
"Use 1x tier for Events only"  
\`\`\`

\#\#\# Filtering by Price  
\`\`\`  
"Show only inventory under $1,000"  
"Remove items over $5,000"  
"Focus on $500-$2,000 range"  
\`\`\`

\#\#\# Geographic Adjustments  
\`\`\`  
"Add all West Side outlets"  
"Remove North Side, keep South Side and Citywide"  
"Include only outlets serving Black communities"  
\`\`\`

\---

\#\# MULTI-MONTH CAMPAIGN CALCULATIONS

\#\#\# How It Works  
\*\*Base formula:\*\* Monthly Package Cost Ã— Number of Months \= Campaign Total

\#\#\# Examples

\*\*3-Month Campaign:\*\*  
\`\`\`  
Monthly: $45,000  
Campaign: $45,000 Ã— 3 \= $135,000  
\`\`\`

\*\*6-Month Campaign:\*\*  
\`\`\`  
Monthly: $45,000  
Campaign: $45,000 Ã— 6 \= $270,000  
\`\`\`

\*\*12-Month Campaign:\*\*  
\`\`\`  
Monthly: $45,000  
Campaign: $45,000 Ã— 12 \= $540,000  
\`\`\`

\#\#\# Important Notes  
\- Most inventory is priced monthly  
\- Radio/Podcast is weekly (we convert: weekly rate Ã— 4.33 \= monthly)  
\- Events are often one-time (specified in notes)  
\- Volume discounts apply via frequency tiers, not duration

\#\#\# Requesting Campaign Calculations  
\`\`\`  
"Show monthly cost and 3-month total"  
"Calculate this package for 6 months"  
"What's the annual cost for this package?"  
\`\`\`

\---

\#\# UNDERSTANDING FREQUENCY TIERS

\#\#\# What Are Frequency Tiers?  
Volume discounts for running ads multiple times per month:  
\- \*\*1x tier:\*\* Ad runs 1 time per month  
\- \*\*6x tier:\*\* Ad runs 6 times per month (discounted per-unit rate)  
\- \*\*12x tier:\*\* Ad runs 12 times per month (best per-unit rate)

\#\#\# Which Channels Have Tiers?  
\- \*\*Print:\*\* Yes (1x, 6x, 12x common)  
\- \*\*Newsletter:\*\* Yes (1x, 6x, 12x common)  
\- \*\*Website:\*\* Some units (many are flat monthly rate)  
\- \*\*Radio:\*\* Sometimes (weekly-based)  
\- \*\*Podcast:\*\* Sometimes (weekly-based)  
\- \*\*Social Media:\*\* Usually flat rate  
\- \*\*Events:\*\* Usually flat rate (one-time events)  
\- \*\*Streaming Video:\*\* Usually flat rate

\#\#\# How to Use Tiers

\*\*Maximize Value:\*\*  
\`\`\`  
"Use 12x tier for all inventory that offers it"  
\`\`\`  
This gives lowest per-insertion cost.

\*\*Budget Conscious:\*\*  
\`\`\`  
"Use 6x tier to balance frequency and cost"  
\`\`\`

\*\*Test First:\*\*  
\`\`\`  
"Start with 1x tier for initial campaign"  
\`\`\`

\#\#\# Tier Limitations  
\- Cannot request custom tiers (e.g., "8x")  
\- Not all inventory offers all tiers  
\- Tiers are pre-set in the data  
\- For custom frequency, outlets must be contacted directly

\---

\#\# COMMON PACKAGE BUILDING SCENARIOS

\#\#\# Scenario 1: Community-Focused Package  
\`\`\`  
Goal: Reach South Side communities within $30K budget

Request:  
"Build $30K/month package for South Side outlets, all channels"

Claude identifies:  
\- 8 South Side outlets  
\- 87 available ad units  
\- Builds package at $28,500/month  
\- Shows channel mix and outlet breakdown  
\`\`\`

\#\#\# Scenario 2: Channel-Specific Campaign

\#\# TIPS FOR EFFECTIVE PACKAGE BUILDING

\#\#\# Start Broad, Then Narrow  
Begin with wide parameters, refine based on what you see:  
\`\`\`  
1\. "Show all South Side inventory"  
2\. Review options  
3\. "Remove Events, focus on Print and Newsletter"  
4\. "Switch to 6x tier"  
5\. Final package emerges  
\`\`\`

\#\#\# Use Comparisons  
Compare different approaches:  
\`\`\`  
"Show me cost for:  
A) All 29 outlets, Newsletter only  
B) 15 outlets, all channels  
C) 10 outlets, Print \+ Website only"  
\`\`\`

\#\#\# Build Incrementally  
Add one outlet or channel at a time:  
\`\`\`  
1\. Start: "Chicago Sun-Times, all channels"  
2\. Add: "Now add WBEZ"  
3\. Add: "Now add South Side Weekly"  
4\. Continue until budget met  
\`\`\`

\#\#\# Check Alternatives  
If over budget:  
\`\`\`  
"Same package but at 6x instead of 12x \- how much savings?"  
"What if we remove the two most expensive outlets?"  
"Can we hit $50K by removing one channel?"  
\`\`\`

\#\#\# Leverage Filtering  
Use Claude's ability to filter:  
\`\`\`  
"Show only newsletter inventory under $800"  
"Which outlets have both Print and Radio?"  
"What's available in $1,000-$3,000 range?"  
\`\`\`

\---

\#\# TROUBLESHOOTING

\#\#\# "Package is over my budget"  
Solutions:  
\- Reduce number of outlets  
\- Remove expensive channels (Events often pricey)  
\- Switch to lower frequency tiers (12x â†’ 6x)  
\- Focus on smaller outlets  
\- Adjust campaign duration

\#\#\# "Need more outlets but at budget limit"  
Solutions:  
\- Focus on lower-cost channels (Social, Streaming Video)  
\- Use 1x tier instead of 12x  
\- Remove premium placements  
\- Target smaller community outlets  
\- Consider phased approach (start with some, add more later)

\#\#\# "Can't find specific inventory"  
Check:  
\- Is the outlet in the system with Hub inventory?  
\- Does that outlet offer that channel?  
\- Try: "Show all channels available for \[outlet name\]"  
\- Query the database for current inventory availability

\#\#\# "Calculations seem off"  
Verify:  
\- Are you looking at monthly or campaign total?  
\- Is frequency tier correct?  
\- Some items have tiered pricing (1x vs 12x very different)  
\- Ask: "Show me detailed cost breakdown"

\#\#\# "Audience numbers needed"  
Remember:  
\- Each channel reports different metrics  
\- Numbers shown are NOT unique people  
\- Cross-channel overlap unknown  
\- See DATA\_LIMITATIONS.md

\---

\#\# NEXT STEPS AFTER PACKAGE BUILDING

1\. \*\*Review package summary\*\* \- Verify outlets, costs, reach  
2\. \*\*Get stakeholder approval\*\* \- Share cost breakdowns  
3\. \*\*Generate insertion orders\*\* \- Use INSERTION\_ORDER\_GUIDE.md  
4\. \*\*Finalize campaign details\*\* \- Dates, creative specs, contacts  
5\. \*\*Submit orders to outlets\*\* \- Individual orders per outlet  
6\. \*\*Track campaign execution\*\* \- Monitor delivery (outside this tool)
